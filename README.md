Features of This Application:

SQLite Database: Tasks are stored in a SQLite database (todo_list.db). This allows for better data management and the ability to perform complex queries.
Task Information: Each task includes a title, description, due date, priority, and status (complete/incomplete).
Task Management: You can add tasks, view tasks with filters, mark tasks as completed or incomplete, and delete tasks.
Filtered View: The task list can be filtered by completion status and sorted by due date.

Setup Instructions:

Dependencies: This script requires Python 3 and the SQLite library (which comes bundled with Python).
Running the Script: Simply run the script in your terminal or command prompt
Database Setup: The database will be created automatically if it doesn't exist when you first run the script.
